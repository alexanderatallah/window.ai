# TODO

- Make it possible for multiple users to chat with the ui app at the same time (BUG)
  - Right now, there is no FROM field being sent from the ui.
- Make the server/chat/gpt3 code chat history generic, don't assume a phone number
- Add a way to reset the chat history from the ui chat client
